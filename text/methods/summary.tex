\section{Summary}

We drew up three different methods for collecting data that could be analyzed using different means and evaluated with respect to different metrics. We also discussed several data collection methods that we considered but ultimately did not pursue due in impracticality, impossibility at this time, or other factors.

Since they are used for analysis on data collected from all methods, we also discussed the statistical methods used to guage differences between the states and determine if the data supports comparisons between them at that level of aggregation. As part of these methods we presented several novel ideas for visualizing these comparisons and a way to possibly work around imperfect data when sorting.
