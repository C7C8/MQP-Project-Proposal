\section{Design}\label{sec:design_web_ping}
The "site ping" site was developed as a tool for crowd-sourced internet speed testing. The site attempts to measure \rtt between an end user and multiple websites in the top 50 Alexa list. The Alexa top 50 list was chosen as a source for sites since it represents a significant fraction of sites that users are most likely to use. The complete list of the sites used by the site may be found in \cref{sec:sites_list}.

\subsection{RTT Measurement}
There is no standardized protocol for measuring the \rtt to an arbitrary web server using only client-side browser technologies. Our solution was to request objects from web servers and measure the time taken for the client to receive them. Due to \cors restrictions,\footnote{\cors is a security policy implemented by browsers, designed to guard against cross-site scripting attacks by preventing scripts from loading resources or sending data to another domain. For instance, if a malicious user injects a script into another user's view of \texttt{foo.com}, that script would \textit{only} be able to send or receive data from \texttt{foo.com}, and not \texttt{bar.com}.} the only way for client-side Javascript to request external objects is using the \html \texttt{img} tag, which is limited to requesting image resources.

\TCP, the underlying transport protocol used for \http, performs a handshake between server and client when establishing a connection. This handshake requires additional packets to be exchanged, adding time to the overall transaction. In addition, modern websites use \httpse, which adds \tls encryption, and a \tls handshake following the \tcp handshake. As a result, simply measuring the time it takes to request an object includes much more then just the time to transfer the data.

To work around this, the website makes two requests for an object from a web server. The first request includes the \http \texttt{keep-alive} parameter, which keeps the \tcp connection open after the transaction is complete. The second request is timed, and because the connection was kept open the timing results do not include the overhead of the \tcp and \tls handshakes.

Because our goal is to measure \rtt, we want data received by the image tag to be transmitted in a single packet -- any more would incur additional delays from extra \tcp packets and acknowledgements. We wrote a plugin for the Google Chrome browser that uses the Chrome developer tools \api to find the smallest image loaded by each of the websites we wanted to test.

\subsection{Geolocation}
Site ping creates and displays a map of the \us with colored data points representing users. The color of the points corresponds to \rtt, and the point's location is that of the user. Texas A\&M's \api is used to determine a user's city in cases where the user's device reports a location (e.g. a smartphone) in geographic coordinates. Otherwise, IP addresses are stored for offline processing using the MaxMind database.

\subsection{Connection Type Reporting}
Since it is important to compare \rtts for comparable devices (e.g. wired (Ethernet), WiFi, or cellular), site ping makes a best-effort attempt to determine each user's connection type. This is done using the "network information" browser \api. This experimental \api is only enabled by default in Google Chrome and Opera but can be manually enabled on Mozilla Firefox. On mobile devices it is only available on Android browsers, and not iOS.

\subsection{Displaying Results to the User}
The site displays a map to the user. This allows users to see not only real-time results of their test when their device reports a location, but also compare their results to others. This was intended to create appeal for users.
