\subsection{ISP mapping}[David V.]
Using the \fcc's comprehensive Fixed Broadband Deployment database \cite{FederalCommunicationsCommission} we can see what the maximum rated connection speed that is offered in each zip code, as well as the number of \isp that serve a given area. Another useful data collection method  for this could be asking users on a distributed website what there rated connection is, and that number can be compared to the "Rated" maximum speed. 

\subsubsection{Rated connection speed for given location speed}
By mapping the rated connection speed for the given location you can get an idea of the "advertised" connection speeds across the country. This data would be useful for users, especially when compared to the measured speeds from the favicon pings or the \caida data. Comparing these measured data points to the advertised data points could also give people an idea if they are able to get what they are paid for.
