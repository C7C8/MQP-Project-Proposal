\section{Summary}

One of the general conclusions that we can draw from the \dns cache manipulation method is that western states fair better when the data is normalized by distance, while states on the East Coast are better with the true \rtt metrics. This makes intuitive sense: the Eastern \us has a higher population density than the west, as well as a higher density of \dns servers. By simple proximity it the East coast is more connected to more of the \us. When you take out that factor, the West coast shines, indicating higher overall quality of \dns connectivity to other states in the United States.
