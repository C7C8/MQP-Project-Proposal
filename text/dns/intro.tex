This chapter focuses on evaluating internet connectivity based on the "\rtt to Regional Locations" (\cref{sec:definition_rtt_regional}), with a focus on measuring \dns infrastructure connectivity as a proxy for overall connectivity. \dns is a crucial component of the internet. By measuring a region's ability to resolve domain names using servers in other regions, we can evaluate how well the first region is connected to the rest of the country. To accomplish this, we used a method called \dns cache manipulation and over 900 \dns servers spread across the United States and measured the \rtt between them. The following sections detail the design, implementation, and results of this method.
