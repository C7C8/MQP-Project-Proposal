\section{Summary}

The analysis of traceroute data from \caida and \ripe Atlas provided a massive quantity of data. During the process we developed a program that could process it all and store it in a database of \textapprox71 billion rows, which we were able to analyze. We devised a new method for normalizing by distance alongside several unique methods of plotting the data, before ultimately settling on an \acrfull{idw} heatmap.

We attempted to perform statistical analyses on the data set to determine if ranking states by internet connectivity was possible, but unfortunately the data did not support such a ranking. We managed to generate a confidence intervals chart and associated table, however, that allow us to at least compare the extreme ends of the data.
