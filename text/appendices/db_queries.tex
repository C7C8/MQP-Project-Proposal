\chapter{Select Database Design}\label{sec:db_queries}

Some database optimization schemes were used to store \caida and \ripe Atlas traceroute/ping data in a performance-friendly way. These are reproduced below for possible future use and to clarify on the database design. The below shows the table, partition, and index definitions for our raw data tables for \caida and \ripe Atlas data. Note that it was somewhat naively assumed that IPv6 addresses would represent a relatively small portion of the dataset.
