\section{Summary}

In summary, we covered the basic architecture of the Internet and how it can be studied through traceroutes or speed test, some common technologies that users will encounter like caching and the domain system, and some techniques relevant to our project like \ip address geolocation and reverse geocoding. As part of our investigations we also covered a pair of notable prior works, namely a past \wpi \mqp and a project that mapped fiber-optic networks in the \us.

All of this information was essential for the completion of our project and will be of use in understanding later chapters.
