Content delivery networks \cdn's are used by many popular websites across to the Internet to deliver content quickly and efficiently to its end users. Content Delivery Networks are made of data centers that are distributed across the world. These data centers are often located near large population centers, and ISP's network backbone. Some \cdn's are even run by the ISP itself, primarily to help alleviate strain on there infrastructure.  Content owners, such as Netflix or Reddit, pay Content Delivery Network providers to host there content on all of there servers around the world and therefor serve it efficiently to the end users. \cite{} One of the drawbacks of \cdn's it can often be difficult to update the data stored within them. As a result they are often used for static content that doesn't get updated very often, such as videos for Netflix or user content that is posted to Reddit. One example of a map can be seen below for Reddit. \todo add image for reddit to show their \cdn.
