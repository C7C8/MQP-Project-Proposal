\section{Content Delivery Networks}\label{sec:background_cdns}
\CDNs are used by many popular websites across the internet to deliver content quickly and efficiently to their end users. \CDNs are made of data centers distributed across the world, often located near large population centers or elements of the internet backbone. Some \cdns are even run by an \isp directly to help alleviate strain on their infrastructure. Content owners, such as Reddit, pay \cdn providers to host their content on the \cdn's servers around the world to serve content more efficiently to users. One of the drawbacks of \cdns are that they can make it more difficult to update content stored within. As a result they are often used for static content that is infrequently updated, such as videos for Netflix or user content that is posted to Reddit.
