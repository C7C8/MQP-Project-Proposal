\section{Content Delivery Networks}\label{sec:background_cdns}
\CDNs are used by many popular websites across the Internet to deliver content quickly and efficiently to their end users. \CDNs are made of data centers that are distributed across the world. These data centers are often located near large population centers or elements of the internet backbone. Some \cdns are even run by an \isp itself, primarily to help alleviate strain on their infrastructure. Content owners, such as Netflix or Reddit, pay \cdn providers to host their content on the \cdn's servers around the world to serve content more efficiently to the end users. One of the drawbacks of \cdns are that they can make it more difficult to update content stored within. As a result they are often used for static content that doesn't get updated very often, such as videos for Netflix or user content that is posted to Reddit. One example of a such a map can be seen in \cref{fig:example_cdn}.
