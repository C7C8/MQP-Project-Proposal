\section{IP Geolocation \& Reverse Geocoding}\label{sec:background_geolocation}
Geolocation services for this project are provided by two sources: Texas A\&M University's reverse geocoding \api, and the MaxMind GeoIP2 database.

The MaxMind database is a set of binary files and an \sdk designed to estimate the location (with a \textapprox50 kilometer resolution) of an \ip address, provided by the company MaxMind. This process is referred to as \textit{\ip geolocation}. The database s imperfect\footnote{Inaccuracies are less a result of quality of data and more a result of the fact that \ip address allocation doesn't follow a meaningful geographic pattern.} but is regarded as best-in-class and is suitable for our use. Unfortunately the database is proprietary, so we have no information on how exactly MaxMind assembles and verifies it.

The Texas A\&M \api provides a reverse geocoding service that converts a set of existing coordinates into a city, state, zipcode, or other information. This is accomplished using open reference data sets (used in reverse; the normal function is to map city/state/zipcode into coordinates) and algorithms to efficiently query the database.
