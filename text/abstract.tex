\begin{abstract}
We evaluated internet connectivity in the United States, drawn from different definitions of connectivity and different methods of analysis. Using DNS cache manipulation, traceroutes, and a crowdsourced “web ping” method we identify patterns in connectivity that correspond to higher population or coastal regions of the US. We analyze the data for quality strengths and shortcomings, establish connectivity heatmaps, state rankings, and statistical measures of the data. We give comparative analyses of the three methods and present suggestions for future work building off this report.
